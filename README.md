# NOCUtils
NOC Minecraft Network Util Plugin for 1.6.4d

Copied over from our older Tekkit Utils Plugin which we made for our patched Tekkit 1.2.9g
This is a very simple plugin and mainly made for our build.

Commands:
- /tableflip
- /unflip
- /shrug
- /rtp

First 3 are chat commands, fourth one is the usual rtp command if you don't want to use the sign method or use the command for donators.

Permissions:
* gg.nocutils.tableflip
* gg.nocutils.unflip
* gg.nocutils.shrug
* gg.nocutils.placetpsign
* gg.nocutils.usertpsign
* gg.nocutils.rtpcommand

This plugin is as is, no responsibility will be on me for the effects of this plugin.
